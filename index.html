            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to
            understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what
            might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
            in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing
            the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
            prodigiously violent instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would
            solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
            and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would
            iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were
            not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
            ocean. “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
            the page and drew a double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s
            starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
            beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known
            undramatically as inflation, looked right. Reaching back across 13.8
            billion years to
            <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at
            the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
            Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
            fabric of space-time — so-called
            <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe
            being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over. Editors’ Picks A Longtime Renter Tested His $650,000 Budget on

            Wants to Talk About Continue reading the main story ‘As Big as It
            Gets’ In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the
            forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
            gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of
            Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part
            of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued,
            “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a
            telegram encoded in gravitational waves.” The ripples manifested
            themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
            that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it
            was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun. Dr.
            Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
            Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
            reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
            Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
            Astrophysical Journal.
