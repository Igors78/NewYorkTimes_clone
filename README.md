## Project requirements

This project is the third in the HTML/CSS module at Microverse

## Requirements fulfilled:

1. Create a new HTML document.
2. Lay out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned.
3. Set up the top navigation bar.
4. Fill in and position the additional sections.
5. Keep your code clean.
6. Remember to use semantic HTML.
7. Make sure you DON‚ÄôT make common mistakes in your CSS styles.

When your feature is ready and Pull request approved, you can merge it to the master branch.
